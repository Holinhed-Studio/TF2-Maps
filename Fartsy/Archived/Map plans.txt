        Cart is backwards
        Cart cannot be pushed after setup
        Broken door (see DJBaphomet for reference embed_)

    Tunnels linking all areas together so there are no visual glitches --test
    Retexture all areas to match each other
    New stormy skybox
    Optimize all areas by loading .prt file
    Link up all path tracks properly and add in checkpoints
    Add sub checkpoints that play random sounds or do random effects
    Add master effect timer that randomly picks an effect or mashes up a song and releases some chaos
    Tornado that yeets current payload?
    Progressively stronger payloads, up to nukes
    Final payload being giant kissone raining from the sky with multiple events following and total calamity
    Perhaps integrate MvM pkop file to map
    End map with Alexander Burden of the Son?
    SFX/Intros playing during song?

    taco bell gong as wave start for taco bell edition
    Ideas to commit to mvm:
    Random sound effects / shit from the hall of fame while fighting robots (TACO BELL ONLY)
    Taco bell is shorter (less robots per wave) but more difficult, more damage and more health?
    Massive graphical update for effects in mvm -- mainly flashing effects / tracers and flying clocks in the skybox when 72323 is sent. Consider smash bros map clock easter egg.
    Going into the teleport causes a massive drop from skybox to ground in a private chamber that plays falling back from brute justice mode.
    make stage collapse into lava with pillars for survival?
    to fix summonerschaos: disable first stop target on rift's tanktrain, Update dovahkiinwarrior with professorfartsalot instead, Remove secret functions below map. Change sky texture to sky_rift .
    add engi mod from brawler to dovahs ass rottenburg 11 and to tower map from o8pc
    add spirit bomb from hbm to dovahs ass 11 -- scratch that, instead it's a giant smug  sayaki playing kissonelovania.
    turn all of map into plugin --done
    make it possible for the bomb to prematurely explode?
    For Chipotle - Start everyone with a ton of money, they MUST invest in protection or die. Give bots 5000% power, spawn spies all about.
