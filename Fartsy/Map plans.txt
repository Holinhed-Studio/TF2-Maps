    Critical problems:
    {
        Doors do not work. Blue move forward/back instead of L/R
        Cart is backwards
        Cart cannot be pushed after setup
        Broken door (see DJBaphomet for reference embed_)

    Tunnels linking all areas together so there are no visual glitches --test
    Retexture all areas to match each other
    New stormy skybox
    Optimize all areas by loading .prt file
    Link up all path tracks properly and add in checkpoints
    Add sub checkpoints that play random sounds or do random effects
    Add master effect timer that randomly picks an effect or mashes up a song and releases some chaos
    Tornado that yeets current payload?
    Progressively stronger payloads, up to nukes
    Final payload being giant kissone raining from the sky with multiple events following and total calamity
    Perhaps integrate MvM pkop file to map
    End map with Alexander Burden of the Son?
    SFX/Intros playing during song?

taco bell gong as wave start for taco bell edition


Ideas to commit to mvm:

Random sound effects / shit from the hall of fame while fighting robots (TACO BELL ONLY??)?
Taco bell is shorter (less robots per wave) but more difficult, more damage and more health?
